* Why is main function declared as int not void?
  Ans: ðŸ‘‰ Because main() is the starting point of the program, and after the program finishes, it must return a status code to the operating system.
      -> int main() means main will return an integer value.
      -> That returned value tells the OS whether the program ran successfully or failed.
    Conclusion: If main() were void, it would not return any status â€” the OS would have no idea whether the program succeeded or failed.
